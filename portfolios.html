        <h2>Week 1: Embedding Vega Lite Charts on Website</h2>
        <container class="acontainer">
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> </div>
        <p>The first chart analyses the unemployment rate. The seond chart shows the GDP loss due to temperature increase for different emerging market countries. Lastly, the last graph is an interactive graph which uses tooltip function in vega and also includes sliders for conducting analysis at different time periods.</p>

        <h2>Week 2: Analysing Debt Owed to IMF From Different Perspectives</h2>
        <container class="acontainer">
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
        <p>The above two graphs show the amount of debt owed to IMF. However, the first graph expresses it in nominal terms and shows that year 2022 is the riskiest unlike graph 2 where growth of GDP is accounted for. Thus, showing us that 1985 was the riskiest year</p>

        <h2>Week 3:UK and France Real GDP comparison </h2>
        <container class="acontainer">
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div>
        <p>The above graphs analyse Real GDP of UK and France overtime. The data is taken from FRED. The first chart portrays the data by usig an area chart. However, as it can be observed that it does not accurately showcase the data. Hence, line chart is used as a substitute for a more accruate representation of the data</p>

        <h2>Week 4: G20 countries Corporate Tax Rates</h2>
        <container class="acontainer">
       <p>The below data was scrapped on python from the Trading Economics website, to access the workbook click<a class="textlink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BooZhWlJ5MxPMm4343wU6eKu9xPsM7si?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
       <p>The graph below shows the Coporate Tax Rate G20 countries as of October 2022. It can be observed from the below graph that asian and emerging countries tend to have a higher corporate tax rate. Where, India has the highest corporate tax rate of approximately 35% as compared to 22% in the United States of America.</p>

        <p>The CPI dashboard below observes CPI for different UK good and Services overtime</p>
        <p>The python code I  used to get the FRED API, click<a class="textlink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ts6r4U-FFjEckeqw9ruW026TS9Q0FqPd?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

           <h2>Week 7: Base Map and Chloropleth for USA</h2> 
           <container class="acontainer">
           <div class = chart id = "Chart18" style = "display: block;"></div>
           <div class = chart id = "Chart19" style = "display: block;"></div>
           <p>I have portrayed individual gun ownership per USA state. The first map is a base map of USA which shows the country. Furthermore the second map is called a chloropleth which color codes the USA map on the basis of the number of guns held by each individual in the different states. The mottivation behind showcasing such data as gun ownership in USA has always been a core political debate.</p>

        <h2>Week 8: Festival of Economics</h2> 
        <container class="acontainer">
        <div class = chart id = "Chart20"></div>
        <div class = chart id = "Chart21"></div>
        <p>I recently attended Festival of Economics event named "What's Next for Central Banks". The two speakers who gave the talk were Dr Jagit Chadha (Director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) and Huw Phill (Chief Economist, Bank of England). Given the highly uncertain macroeconomic environment right now, the talk was majorly focused around inflation and the central bank interest rate hike. Dr Chadha had a critical view of BOE's policy saying that it was late with the hike decision whereas Huw Phill stressed that Bank was doing everything in its power to bring back inflation to normal levels. In reality, if we analyse the above two graphs, it can be observed that depite BOE's aggresive rate hike policy it has failed to tame the inflation and with energy prices being sticky, thus preventing BOE from controlling the inflation there is no doubt that rate hikes will continue in the future. However, I agree with Huw Phill's view that because rate hikes have lag effects it will take significant time to return back to 2% level.</p>

        <h2>Week 9: Regressions</h2> 
        <container class="acontainer">
        <div class = chart id = "Chart22"></div>
        <div class = chart id = "Chart23"></div>
        <p>The first chart regresses Montly returns of S&P 500 equity index on Monthly Federal Funds Rate. Whereas, the second chart regresses the monthly yields of Investment Grade Corporate Bonds on Mothly Fed Funds Rate. It can be observed that the R^2 for first regression (0.03) is signifcanlty lower than the second regression (0.81). Thus, implicating that a change in monthly in Fed Funds rate explains signficantly higher variance in investment grade corprorate bond yields as compared to variations in monthly S&P 500 returns. </p>

        <h2>Week 10 & 11: Machine Learning</h2> 
        <container class="acontainer">
            <div class="wrap"></div>
            <p>The python code I  used to do the machine learing, click<a class="textlink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZndxSwpDubWmsNQImaiGxax6ntCB8QjO?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The python code I  used to get the machine learning, click<a class="textlink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NmvkThp2d3Wqs-FgVxui99t6e7cZtnXB?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
            <p>The above two images depict tasks based on machines learning in pyhton. The first task is focused on the criteria of calssification within supervised learning and the second on is focused on the criteria of dynamic time wrapping within unsupervised learning. The first image plots 178 wines from 3 winemakers and classifies it based on the color intensity and hue of each wine. The second image uses dynamic time wrapping to investigate which sectoral investmnet grade bonds moves the closes during 2022. It concludes that Telecom and Consumer sector bonds moved closes to each other and financial sector bonds weare an outlier</p>
