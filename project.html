            <h1>Sectoral Vulnerability to Fed Rate Hikes: Investment Grade Corporate Bonds</h1>
            
            <h2>Chart 1: Federal Funds Effective Rate Overtime</h2>
            <div class="acontainer">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
            <p>The Federal Reserve Effective Funds Rate for the period 2010-2022 is shown in the chart. This rate influences the yield on bonds, as a higher rate makes the returns on bonds less appealing and causes a sell-off of bonds. The rate rose sharply in March 2022, due to supply chain disruptions causing inflation. As of January 5, 2023, the rate is 4.33%, which is 166.5% higher than the peak rate during 2010-2022 on March 24, 2019. The data for the chart was obtained from FRED API and extracted in json format from Collab.</p>

            <h2>Chart 2: Regressing Investment Grade Corporate Yields on Fed Funds Rate</h2>
            <div class="acontainer">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
            <p>This chart shows a regression analysis of the relationship between the monthly investment grade corporate bond yields of S&P 500 companies and the monthly Federal Funds Rate. The data for corporate bond yields was obtained from the S&P Dow Jones Indices website in csv form, and the Federal Funds Rate data was obtained using a Fred API. The R^2 value, which represents the explanatory power of the Federal Funds Rate on bond yields, is 0.81. This indicates that 81% of the variation in corporate bond yields can be explained by changes in the monthly Federal Funds Rate, suggesting a strong relationship between the two variables.</p>

            <h2>Chart 3: Sectoral Investment Grade Corporate Yields Over time </h2>
            <div class="acontainer">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
            <p>The relationship between changes in the monthly Federal Funds Rate and corporate bond yields is statistically significant, so it is worth analysing the performance of corporate bonds in different sectors over time. The chart above shows the sectoral yields from 2013 to 2022. It can be seen that yields have increased during times of economic uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and periods of aggressive interest rate hikes. Over the given period, investment grade financial corporate yields have increased the most (116%), while yields for consumer discretionary corporates have increased the least (68%). The original csv is stacked on google collab using python and then converted to a json.</p>

            <h2>Chart 4: Analysis of Investment Grade Corporate Yields in 2022 using Machine Learning</h2>
            <div class="acontainer">

            <p>This analysis extends the examination of sectoral investment grade corporate bond yields using DTW, a machine learning method for comparing the movement of bond yields across sectors in 2022. DTW calculates Z-scores to measure the similarity between sequences in a time series data. The numbers on each branch show the distance between the sequences during the wrapping process. The chart reveals that in 2022, S&P Industrial and Consumer corporate yields moved closest to each other, with an average distance of 0.37 between their Z-scores. Financial sector yields were an outlier, while energy and telecom yields had characteristics closer to industrial and consumer corporates rather than financial corporates.</p>

               <h2>Chart 5: Impact of Fed Funds Rate on Sectoral Investment Grade Corporate Yields</h2> 
               <div class="acontainer">
               <div class = chart id = "Chart4"></div>
               <p>The final chart examines the sensitivity of sectoral investment grade credit yields to changes in the Federal Funds Rate. A line chart is used to plot the daily change in yields for each sector over time, with the dates of Federal Reserve rate hikes marked by a black dashed line. The sectoral yields were more reactive to the first four hikes, which the market did not fully anticipate, compared to the subsequent three hikes, which were more accurately priced in. Upon analysing the six rate hike days, it was found that the financial sector exhibited the greatest average change in yields (1.20%), followed by the consumer (1.18%), telecom (1.20%), industrial (1.09%), and energy (0.79%) sectors. These results suggest a differential sensitivity between the sectors.</p>
