        <h1>Sectoral Vulnerability to Fed Rate Hikes: Investment Grade Corporate Bonds</h1>
        <div class="heading-and-paragraph">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In 2022, the Federal Reserve implemented a particularly aggressive cycle of interest rate hikes, raising the federal funds rate by 425 basis points. This had a significant impact on fixed income securities, with yields on "risk-free" US 10-year Treasury bonds surpassing 3.5%. Corporate debt is a significant portion of the fixed income market, with the CFA Institute reporting that over $1 trillion is financed annually in this sector. This study aims to examine the sensitivity of investment grade bond yields in different sectors of the corporate debt market to the interest rate hikes implemented by the Federal Reserve. Using machine learning and regression techniques, the analysis will be conducted on data from the S&P 500 Corporate Bond Indices, focusing on the telecommunications, consumer discretionary, energy, financials, and industrials sectors.</p>

            <h2>Chart 1: Federal Funds Effective Rate Overtime</h2>
            <div class="acontainer">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
            <p>The Federal Reserve Effective Funds Rate for the period 2010-2022 is shown in the chart. This rate influences the yield on bonds, as a higher rate makes the returns on bonds less appealing and causes a sell-off of bonds. The rate rose sharply in March 2022, due to supply chain disruptions causing inflation. As of January 5, 2023, the rate is 4.33%, which is 166.5% higher than the peak rate during 2010-2022 on March 24, 2019. The data for the chart was obtained from FRED API and extracted in json format from Collab.</p>

            <h2>Chart 2: Regressing Investment Grade Corporate Yields on Fed Funds Rate</h2>
            <div class="acontainer">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
            <p>This chart shows a regression analysis of the relationship between the monthly investment grade corporate bond yields of S&P 500 companies and the monthly Federal Funds Rate. The data for corporate bond yields was obtained from the SPDJ Indices website in csv form, and the Federal Funds Rate data was obtained using a Fred API. The R^2 value of 0.81, which represents the explanatory power of the Federal Funds Rate on bond yields indicates that 81% of the variation in corporate bond yields can be explained by changes in the monthly Federal Funds Rate.</p>
            </div>
           
            <h2>Chart 3: Sectoral Investment Grade Corporate Yields Over time </h2>
            <div class="acontainer">
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
            <p>The relationship between changes in the monthly Federal Funds Rate and corporate bond yields is statistically significant, so it is worth analysing the performance of corporate bonds in different sectors over time. The chart above shows the sectoral yields from 2013 to 2022. It can be seen that yields have increased during times of economic uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and periods of aggressive interest rate hikes. Over the given period, investment grade financial corporate yields have increased the most (116%), while yields for consumer discretionary corporates have increased the least (68%). The original csv is stacked on google collab using python and then converted to a json.</p>

            <h2>Chart 4: Analysis of Investment Grade Corporate Yields in 2022 using Machine Learning</h2>
            <div class="acontainer">

            <p>This analysis extends the examination of sectoral investment grade corporate bond yields using Dynamic time Wrapping, a machine learning method for comparing the movement of bond yields across sectors in 2022. DTW calculates Z-scores to measure the similarity between sequences in a time series data. The numbers on each branch show the distance between the sequences during the wrapping process. The chart reveals that in 2022, S&P Industrial and Consumer corporate yields moved closest to each other. Financial sector yields were an outlier, while energy and telecom yields had characteristics closer to industrial and consumer corporates rather than financial corporates.</p>

               <h2>Chart 5: Impact of Fed Funds Rate on Sectoral Investment Grade Corporate Yields</h2> 
               <div class="acontainer">
               <div class = chart id = "Chart4"></div>
               <p>The final chart examines the sensitivity of sectoral investment grade credit yields to changes in the Federal Funds Rate. A line chart is used to plot the daily change in yields for each sector over time, with the dates of Federal Reserve rate hikes marked by a black dashed line. The sectoral yields were more reactive to the first four hikes, which the market did not fully anticipate, compared to the subsequent three hikes, which were more accurately priced in. Upon analysing the seven rate hike days, it was found that the financial sector exhibited the greatest average change in yields (1.20%), followed by the consumer (1.18%), telecom (1.20%), industrial (1.09%), and energy (0.79%) sectors. These results suggest a differential sensitivity between the sectors.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In summary, the results of the regression analysis show that the Federal Funds Rate has a strong impact on Investment Grade Corporate Yields. Over the past 7 years, financials corporate bond yields were the most volatile, while consumer discretionary bond yields were the least volatile. Industrial sector bonds were found to be similar to consumer discretionary bonds according to an the DTW algorithm, while financials corporate bonds did not exhibit significant similarities to other sectors in 2022. In terms of sensitivity to Federal Funds Rate hikes, the financial sector was most affected, while the energy sector was least affected in 2022. This research offers valuable insights for pricing different sector bonds in the future when the central bank is raising rates and offers potential for further studies using similar models to examine the high yields sector.</p>
